## The Workflow 

A general workflow for social network analysis can be designed following serveral steps:

2. Non-Structural Social Network - networkx.Graph
3. Structural Array  - pandas.DataFrame or numpy.array
4. Summary and Visualization

### Raw Data to Social Network

### Network to Array

## Design Principles 

A general principle to make the design easiler is to design from the data structure friendly to human to that to machine, connecting them with algorithms and processings.
